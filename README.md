# ChatLogger

ChatLogger is a plugin that records all chat messages and commands that can later be viewed by administators

##### Storage
Currently, only MySQL is supported for storing these chat messages. Adding insupport for other databases such as MongoDB
is on my list of things to do for this project. 


##### Viewing the chat logs
The three options for viewing logs are:
* ~~Pasting to a file (must have access to the server folder to view)~~ Not supported yet
* [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)
* [Hastebin](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) (You must be running your own Hastebin server)

Here is a preview of using Pastebin:
